"""
Defines the structure for tools and registers available tools for Emigo.

This module provides:
- TypedDict definitions for ToolParameter and ToolDefinition.
- Concrete definitions for each available tool, linking to their implementation
  in tools.py.
- A TOOL_REGISTRY dictionary for easy access to all tool definitions.
- Helper functions to retrieve tool definitions.

You must tailor your command to the user's system and provide a clear explanation of what the command does. For command chaining, use the appropriate chaining syntax for the user's shell. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, as they are more flexible and easier to run.",

Use this tool *only* when the user has explicitly instructed you to read a specific file path or you have already used list_repomap and identified this specific file as necessary for the next step. Do NOT use this tool based on guesses about where functionality might reside; use list_repomap first in such cases. Use this tool if the file's content is not already present in <environment_details>. Reading a file will add its content to <environment_details> for subsequent turns. May not be suitable for other types of binary files, as it returns the raw content as a string.",

WRITE_TO_FILE_TOOL = ToolDefinition(
    name="write_to_file",

One or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks following this exact format:
````
<<<<<<< SEARCH
[exact content to find]
=======
[new content to replace with]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
````
Critical rules:
1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:
   * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings
   * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.
2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.
   * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.
   * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
   * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.
3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:
   * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
   * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
   * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
   * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.
4. Special operations:
   * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)
   * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section""", required=True),

It uses a ranking algorithm (PageRank) to prioritize the most important and interconnected parts of the code, especially considering files already discussed or mentioned. This provides a concise yet informative overview, far more useful than a simple file listing (list_files) or reading individual files (read_file) when you need to understand the project's architecture, identify where specific functionality resides, or plan complex changes. **When unsure where functionality resides or how code is structured, you MUST use list_repomap first.** It is much more efficient and context-aware than guessing file paths and using read_file sequentially. Use list_repomap to get a map of the relevant code landscape before diving into specific files. The analysis focuses on the source files within the session directory. The result of this tool will be added to the <environment_details> for subsequent turns.",

Do not attempt further refinements unless explicitly asked. If there are commands the user should run to see or use the result (e.g., 'open index.html', 'python app.py', 'npm start'), mention them in your result text. The user may provide feedback if unsatisfied, which you can use to make improvements and try again.",
