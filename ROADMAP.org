- [ ] Re-run last command easily
- [ ] Command history browser

* Priority 6: File Operations
** TODO Diff preview & undo
- [ ] Show diff before applying changes (like magit)
- [ ] Undo last AI edit
- [ ] File operation log
- [ ] Highlight files in context

* Priority 7: Context Management
** TODO Large file & history handling
- [ ] Smart context pruning
- [ ] Context size warnings
- [ ] Visual indicator of files in context
- [ ] Easy add/remove without typing paths

* Priority 8: Session Management
** TODO Save/load sessions
- [ ] Save conversation to file
- [ ] Load previous sessions
- [ ] Multiple concurrent sessions per project
- [ ] Export to markdown/org

* Priority 9: Keybindings & UX
** TODO Quick actions
- [ ] ~C-c e r~ - Retry last request
- [ ] ~C-c e u~ - Undo last change
- [ ] ~C-c e c~ - Clear history
- [ ] ~C-c e +/-/=~ - Adjust window width (DONE)

** TODO Region-based edits
- [ ] Select text → ~C-c e e~ → AI edits selection
- [ ] Insert AI response at point
- [ ] Copy code blocks easily

* Priority 10: Developer Experience
** TODO Debug & testing
- [ ] Debug mode showing API calls/responses
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Test mode with mock responses
- [ ] Per-project system prompts

* Priority 11: Performance Optimization
** DONE Fix critical performance issue in emigo--flush-buffer
- [X] Cache prompt position with emigo--prompt-marker (avoid O(n) searches)
- [X] Remove redundant second buffer search (lines 695-698)
- [X] Replace emigo-lock-region with efficient emigo--update-readonly-region
- [X] Reuse single overlay instead of creating new ones per character
- [X] Update prompt marker on buffer creation and clear
- [X] Result: O(1) per character instead of O(n), massive speedup

* Priority 12: Natural Conversation Flow
** IN-PROGRESS Remove ask_followup_question tool
- [X] Remove tool from tool_definitions.py
- [X] Update system prompt to allow natural questions
- [X] Keep Emacs-side handler (may be useful for future features)

- [X] Update description to mention commands in result text instead
- [X] Update Python function to not send command
- [X] Update Emacs function to not expect command
- [X] Update visual enhancement to match new signature

- [X] Log tool name, role, tool-id, and actual content
- [X] Log complete JSON parameters when tool call ends
- [X] Create reusable utility function for tool parameter display
- [X] Add visual displays for ALL tools:

  - write_to_file: ✏️ filename (blue)
  - replace_in_file: 🔧 filename (yellow)
  - search_files: 🔍 pattern (magenta)
